g.	A fiberglass Fish Trough and pre-cast concrete Trash Trough run East and West along the south side of the Intake Structure
1)	The Fish Trough has diversion gates at the north and south ends of the Intake Structure to allow the collection of marine life in Fish Counting Pools for inventory and examination
2)	Captured marine life and debris in both troughs are joined at each end of the Intake Structure and are sluiced back into the Delaware River
TP-34, TP-35
3)	The Detritus Discharge Pipe was installed to discharge  the screen debris further away from the CW pump suctions to minimize detritus return. The 600 ft, 48 inch piping, takes a suction from the modified North Fish house. The old screen debris troughs will remain functional.         
2EC-3361
h.	DCP 2EC-3361 was completed to prevent spurious trips during the winter months due to additional heating loads.  The DCP modified the following:
1)	Replaced the 150 amp feeder breaker (I2125-2GY1) to the Circulating Water 230 VAC Control Center with a 300 amp breaker.
2)	The feed transformer was upgraded to a 220 KVA transformer from 150 KVA to allow for connecting Unit 2 and Unit 1 without exceeding the transformer rating.
3)	The cross-tie Breakers I1125-2IY1 and I2125-2IY1 were increased from 300 amps to 350 amp breakers.
4)	Based on making the above described changes to the No. 2 CWI 230 V System it was also necessary under this modification to replace the upstream 460V Breaker 2CW1X with higher rated trip device breaker at the No. 2 CWI 460 Bus in order to carry the load of the replacement transformer.

a.	Installed between each Trash Bar Rack and Circulating Water Pump
b.	Filter finer debris and marine life from reaching the Circulating Water Pumps' suction
TP-7,TP-31
Note:  13A and 13B Circulating Water Traveling Screens also have unique design features/differences.  13A and 13B Traveling Screens also do not have shear pins and use a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD).  The 13A Traveling Screen itself is unique, it is a Geiger MultiDisc Screen (MDS).  See Unit Differences Section.    
c.	Each screen assembly is a loop of basket screen panels; 1/4" x 1/2" mesh; made from composite material
1)	Chain and sprocket driven by 15 hp motors
d.	For all screens except 23B, shear pins protect against overload torque
1)	1 shear pin per Traveling Screen on the coupling between the screen motor and the screen sprocket
a)	1 shear pin now used to reduce cyclic stresses caused from using two shear pins.  With two pins each pin would constantly load and unload.
2)	Debris buildup on the screen can create an overload condition which shears the pins
3)	The shear pins are replaced by the Circ Water Operator as required
e.	23B traveling screen is equipped with a flexible coupling which has no shear pin.  Overtorque protection is provided by an overtorque device in the screen Variable Frequency Drive.
TP 31 
f.	Unit 1 and 2 are equipped upstream and downstream with radar detectors used to determine delta P across the traveling screens.
g.	The screens automatically travel at a speed proportional to the differential head across the screen
5.	Impinged marine life and debris are carried by the ascending bucket screens up and over the head sprockets
6.	As the baskets start to descend, the marine life and loose debris fall or are flushed into fish and debris troughs for return to the river or disposal
ELO 9.a
7.	All Traveling Screen's except 23B have their speed locally controlled by a four-position selector switch:
a.	STOP
b.	AUTO:
1)	0" - 4" dP:   6 fpm
2)	4" - 8" dP:  12 fpm
3)	8" - 12" dP: 18 fpm
4)	>12" dP:     36 fpm
5)	These screen speeds are referred to as Low, Second, Third, and High speeds
c.	MAN: Low, Second, Third, or High speeds can be selected with a separate selector switch for each screen
d.	INCH: The screen can be jogged in the forward or reverse direction at Low Speed with separate push-buttons locally mounted near each screen
1)	Jogging the screens in the forward or reverse directions aids routine operator maintenance of the screens (e.g., screen greasing, shear pin replacement, etc.)
S2.OP-SO.CW-0001, ATTACHMENT 4
8.	23B Traveling Screen has a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD), which continuously varies the speed of the traveling screen motor proportional to the differential pressure across the screen rather than the four discrete speeds on the remaining screens.  The VFD is controlled locally by a Screen Inverter Bypass Switch, a four-position Screen Control switch and a keypad.  Using Attachment 4 of S2.OP-SO.CW-0001:
a.	The Screen Inverter Bypass Switch is a two position switch:
1)	INVERTER:  the VFD control unit determines the speed of the motor and screen.
2)	BYPASS:  the VFD control unit is bypassed and the motor is connected directly its power supply breaker.  There is no overtorque protection provided in this mode.
b.	The Screen Control switch has four positions:
1)	STOP
2)	AUTO:  The VFD varies the frequency of the drive motor and thus the screen speed in proportion to the differential pressure across the screen.  The screen speed varies from 6 to 36 fpm for screen differentials from 0 to 12 inches.
3)	MAN: To Raise / Lower speed while In Manual Control (Inverter Selector in Inverter Position)
a)	SELECT keypad display to indicate speed (Hz).
b)	USE Raise (Up Arrow) OR Lower (Down Arrow) to set keypad reference hertz to desired value of frequency for a given speed IAW with Chart.
c)	PLACE Screen Control Switch in MANUAL AND VERIFY local light on keypad illuminates.
d)	VERIFY Display shows speed raising OR lowering to desired value.
e)	WHEN MANUAL Control is no longer desired, THEN PLACE Control Switch in AUTO AND VERIFY the REMOTE light on keypad illuminates.
4)	INCH: The screen can be jogged in the forward or reverse direction at Low Speed with separate push-buttons locally mounted near each screen.
a)	Jogging the screens in the forward or reverse directions aids routine operator maintenance of the screens (e.g., screen greasing.) 
9.	The Traveling Screens are powered from Circulating Water Intake Distribution Panel DP2, which is fed from the Circulating Water Intake 2CW-460V Bus

10.	Screen Wash Sub-System
a.	Four Screen Wash Pumps per unit are installed in the Intake Structure
1)	Located in the pump bays/screenwells for Circulating Water Pumps 22A/B and 23A/B
b.	150 hp; 1500 gpm capacity
ELOs 3.a & 4.f  TP-8
Strainer backwash valves and operation have been changed by DCP EC-3303.
c.	Each Screen Wash Pump discharges through an automatic cleaning strainer
1)	The strainers are interlocked with their respective Screen Wash Pumps for rotation and backwash functions
a)	The Screen Wash Strainer starts when the pump starts and are rotated by an integral motor.
b)	The strainer motor starts and is continuously in service when the pump is running.  There is a constant controlled blowdown from each strainer that is in operation.  This blowdown backwashes debris from the strainer.  Continuous blowdown backwash was accomplished by drilling an orifice through the “closed” position of a manual ball valve. The ball valve can be manually opened to flush out any excess debris that may accumulate.
c)	The strainer delta P switches are now no longer required and have been removed by the DCP
d)	Strainer pressure gauges have been upgraded to a diaphragm sealed filled gauges to isolate them from the debris filled water and the gauge face will be liquid filled to dampen pointer pulsation’s.
2)	Each strainer has a locally mounted push-pull AUTO/MAN control switch (Abandoned in place)
d.	All four pumps' discharges are combined into a common 8" header which supplies 6 - 4" lines; one line to each Traveling Screen.  Normal header pressure is approximately 110-120 psig.  The typical operating pressure range (based on Auto Start and Stop set points for the screen wash pumps) is 90 to 135 psig.  Once the screen is running and pressure decreases to 30 psig, with no screen wash pumps running, the screen trips off. (The screenwash pressure permissive has been permanently jumpered out IAW DCP 80096076,80093380 FOR ALL BUT 13A. This bypasses the screenwash pressure requirement for the CW screen start).
e.	The Unit 1 and Unit 2, 8" Screen Wash Headers can be cross-connected through two normally closed valves (1SC-914 and 2SC-929) as a backup supply for each other
ELO 4.e, 9.b
f.	Screen Wash Pump Control
1)	Each Screen Wash Pump has a locally mounted STOP/AUTO/RUN control switch which is interlocked through a common Primary Pump Selector Switch
2)	A 4-position Primary Pump Selector Switch selects one of the four Screen Wash Pumps (21/22/23/24) as the primary pump for screen wash service
3)	If a Screen Wash Pump is selected as the primary pump and its control switch is in AUTO, then the pump will automatically start whenever any of the 6 Traveling Screens is running and Traveling screen delta P is > 4”.
4)	The primary pump should be placed in the manual position.  The remaining available pumps should be placed in auto.  The screen will not run without screen wash pressure.
5)	The Screen Wash Pump can also be started by selecting the RUN position on the pump's control switch, or by a local push-button at each pump's breaker cubicle
6)	Screen Wash Pumps selected for AUTO operation, but not selected as the primary pump are designated as auxiliary pumps:
a)	Start automatically in a time-delayed sequence if screen wash header pressure decreases to <90 psig
b)	Stop automatically in a time-delayed sequence as screen wash header pressure increases >135 psig
ELO 5.a
7)	Power Supplies:
a)	All four Screen Wash Pumps are powered from the Circulating Water Intake 2CW-460V Bus
b)	All four Screen Wash Pump Strainers are powered from Section 1 of the Circulating Water Intake 230V Control Center
8)	Screen Wash Water is automatically supplied to a Traveling Screen whenever the screen's control switch is selected to AUTO or MAN
TPs 9, 10, & 11
9)	As the Traveling Screen baskets rotate over the top sprocket and change vertical position, they encounter Screen Wash Spray headers in this order:
a)	One 2" fish sluice spray upper header outside the screen (8 - 12 psig)
b)	Two 2" fish removal spray upper headers inside the screen (21 - 25 psig)
c)	One 3" high pressure debris spray header inside the screen (> 70 psig)
d)	One 3” (manual) Aux. high pressure spray header inside the screen(> 70 psig).
10)	DCPs 1EE00407 & 2EE0344 removed the 2 automatic pressure regulators for fish spray.  Manual valves are now used to control Screen Wash Header pressure to the inside and outside spray header (Inside header pressure is normally set to 21-25 psig) (Outer header pressure is normally set to 8-12 psig) 
11)	The three upper headers are blown down through individual isolation valves to remove accumulated debris and mud from the headers and spray nozzles, as required
g.	An additional 3” (manual) Aux. high pressure debris spray header (> 70 psig) inside the screen is manually placed into service whenever:
1)	Screen differential head exceeds 8"
2)	Screen Third Speed or High Speed is manually selected
Note: Aux spray is normally in service and only closed if low screen wash pressure occurs due to lack of operable pumps.  Also see Unit Differences section for a discussion on 13B Traveling Screen front spray.  The manual aux spray for 13B traveling screen will be isolated if the front spray is in service. Supplemental Screen Wash Pumps will be used as needed.
TPs 9,10,10A,32,33
h.	Flexible rubber "fish and debris lips" mounted on the Fish and Trash Troughs keep debris and marine life from falling or being sprayed directly down into the screen wells
1)	Up to several times each shift, depending upon the amount of debris buildup, the fish and debris lips are manually raked clean inside each Traveling Screen housing by the Circ Water Operator
2)	DCP 80043348 modified the fish lips.  Screens with the DCP installed have “hinged” fish lips.  This mod allows the operator to move the fish lip away from the rotating screen element while the lip is being raked.  This is a safety enhancement to the system. 
Note: It is not  necessarily required isolate the water to clean fish lip – just get it a little wet
3)	To clean inside the housing, each Traveling Screen's Screen Wash Water is completely isolated by closing its manual isolation valve (SC-8s/108s) off the common Screen Wash Header

                                        supplementary pumps will be permanently installed at 
                                        CWIS. One pump is located on the north end of CWIS 
                                        and the other located on the south end. The pumps will
                                        draw a suction from 13B and 23B intake bays. The 
                                        discharges of the pump tie to a common header that will
                                        discharge to the north,south, and mid-point of the troughs
                                        The flow to each trough is 25% to the upper and 75%
                                        to the lower. The flow to the troughs are capable of
                                        adjusted with valves. The pumps are normally not 
                                        running and are manually started as needed.

a)	Circulator Bearing Lubrication Water pressure > 14 psig
b)	When the associated condenser water box vacuum reaches < 1 " Hg, the start permissive contact is closed and the vacuum breakers will be automatically closed.  The “READY TO START” light will be on continuously (if all other permissives are met as well).
Note: The “READY TO START” push-button was added by dcp 2EC-3465.  When it is depressed it functions as follows:
•	Outlet Valve CW26 closes
•	Bypass Valve CW9 opens
•	Waterbox vacuum breakers (CW15/20/21 and 25) to cycle to maintain pressure      < 2.5 “ Hg vacuum
	The “READY TO START” light will initially flash when depressed, once all start permissives are satisfied the light will change from flashing to steady, indicating the pump is ready to start.
•	If the condenser waterbox vacuum increases to greater then 2.5” hg after the “READY TO START” push-button has been depressed, the pump start permissive is lost.  At that time, the “READY TO START” light will resume flashing and the vacuum breakers will be automatically open to reduce vacuum.

2)	Setpoint: > 12" H2O dP
3)	Possible Causes:
a)	Traveling Screen differential pressure(dp) high
b)	Traveling Screen motor overload
c)	Loss of power
4)	Automatic actions: None
5)	The high dp alarm is confirmed from control console indication, and an operator is sent to correct the condition. 
a)	If two or more Circulators are stopped, then go to S2.OP-AB.CW-0001(Q), Circulating Water System Malfunction
b.	Window K-9: 21-23B CW SCRNWSH TRBL
1)	Possible Causes - same as Window K-1 except for 23B Traveling Screen.  A VFD fault on 23B Traveling Screen will also initiate this alarm and stop 23B Traveling Screen.
a)	For VFD faults the screen may be run in BYPASS at the discretion of the CRS.
c.	Window K-25: CW SCRNWSH PRESS LO
1)	Device:  2DP3122-2
2)	Setpoint:   <90 psig
3)	Cause:  Screenwash Pump header pressure <90 psig
4)	Automatic action:  If selected, the standby Screenwash Pump will automatically start
5)	An operator is sent to ensure proper strainer operation and to investigate for leaks
6)	Additional pumps are started if required

6)	If necessary, an additional Bearing Lube Pump can be started, or the emergency backup supply from the Screenwash header can be valved in
7)	Monitor Circulator Bearing temperatures and remove affected Circulators if excessive temperatures exist.
e.	Window K-34:  4KV CW BUS UNDRVOLT 
1)	Devices:  27BX23, 27BX24
2)	Setpoint:  <70% of nominal voltage for  0.3 seconds (63B23/TR / 63B24/TR)
3)	Cause:  Low voltage on either 2CW 4KV Bus Section 23 OR Bus Section 24
4)	Automatic Actions:  
a)	2CW Bus Section 23 UV:
•	Trips 21-23A Circulating Water Pump breakers.
•	Trips 2CW Bus Section 23 infeed breaker (23CW1AD).
•	By design there is NO automatic transfer of 2CW Bus Section 23 to 2CW Bus Section 24.
b)	2CW Bus Section 24 UV:
•	Trips 21-23B Circulating Water Pump breakers.
•	Trips 2 CW Bus Section 24 infeed breaker (24CW9AD).
•	Automatically transfers 2CW Bus Section 24 to 2CW Bus Section 23 (62B24A/TR set @ 15 seconds).
5)	Note that this OHA response describes the automatic and operator actions possible due to DCP 80067687 (Unit 1 – 80067687).  
a)	The design change allows the two 4160/480 volt Auxiliary transformers that are normally connected to CW bus 24 to transfer to bus 23 in the event the infeed breaker for CW bus 24 trips.  Availability of power to all associated support equipment powered from these two auxiliary load transformers allows the continued operation of all of the operating Alpha CW pumps.
b)	The design change does not allow any of the CW pumps on either bus section to be transferred automatically in either direction in the event the corresponding infeed breaker trips.  
c)	However, this design change does allow manual re-start of Bravo CW pumps from CW Bus Section 23 after the slow/dead bus transfer if CW Bus Section 24 fails and Alpha CW pumps from CW Bus Section 24 after manual transfer IAW procedure S1(2).OP-SO.4KV-0009 from CW Bus Section 23 to24 if CW Bus Section 23 fails. 
d)	Again, note that this automatic slow/dead bus transfer applies only for transfer from bus 24 (where the auxiliaries are fed) to 23 and does not apply for bus transfer from bus 23 to 24.  Transferring CW Bus Section 23 to CW Bus Section 24 is accomplished by manual transfer in accordance with Operations Procedure S1(2).OP-SO.4KV-0009.

VI.	UNIT DIFFERENCES
A.	Presently, each Unit 1 Intake Structure Heating Fan is interlocked with the pair of Circulating Water Pumps it serves
1.	A Unit 1 Heating Fan will start, if in AUTO, whenever either of the pair of Circulating Water Pumps it serves starts
a.	The Unit 2 Heating Fans are not interlocked with the Circulating Water Pumps, and are manual start and stop only; the AUTO position on their handswitches has no function
B.	Design change package 80084307 has added a front (river side) debris spray for 13B Circulating Water Traveling Screen.  This new front spray arrangement includes:
1.	A separate front (river side) fiberglass trough for 13B traveling screen (routed to the existing debris trough), 
2.	A stationary flap seal to the front side of the 13B screen, 
3.	A front spray wash line to the screen, 
4.	Two new isolation valves to isolate either the manual aux spray or the front spray. 
This front spray system is of the same design as the rear primary and auxiliary debris sprays.  This front spray system is fed from the existing screen wash pumps and headers and operates at the same flow rate and pressure as the existing rear debris headers, approximately 240 gpm at 90 psi.  Valve configuration will allow either the auxiliary rear spray or the front spray to be in service at one time.  However, operationally, only one of these two sprays (aux rear spray or front spray) will be in service at a time. 
C.	Design change package 80088436 has replaced 13A Circulating Water Traveling Screen with a unique, Geiger MultiDisc Screen.  This design change and the 13B front spray modification described above are both aimed at reliability improvements for the Circulating Water Traveling Screens.  These modifications are being made for testing and data collection to determine possible future circulating water intake changes.
The Geiger Screen’s design is being used to help eliminate excessive condenser fouling from the carryover of debris that occurs with the original screen design.  With the original design (remaining 11 screens), it is common for river grass to fall between the traveling screen and the rear flap seals and into the CW intake bay.  The grass is then pumped through the circulators and into the condensers where it plugs up the tubes.  The Geiger MultiDisc Screen (MDS) has all of its screens on one side of the machine, thus eliminating the carry-over of debris to the circulator intake side of the bay.  The screen’s control system allows for a variable screen speed profile to meet changes in differential pressure across the screens from changeable river grass and debris loading.  
TP-7A&B
Review 13A Traveling Screen Controls Attachment in S1.OP-SO.CW-0001(Z), Circulating Water System Operation.
1.	The MultiDisc Screen has a thru-flow flow pattern.  The raw water flows directly through the mesh panels without change of the flow direction. The total submerged screening area, that is, the descending and ascending mesh panels as well as mesh panels in the lower guiding section, is used to screen raw water. The screenings are retained at the front of the mesh panels. As the screen band travels through the water body, the collected screenings will be carried upwards to the discharge position above deck level, where they will be washed off by a spray water device into the collecting trough. The spraying of mesh panels is with a suitable pressure to achieve a high intensity of cleaning of mesh panels.  Due to the design of circulating sickle shaped panels across the channel no carry over of debris to the clean water side can occur.
2.	The main components of the MultiDisc Screen are the sickle shaped mesh panels, one central chain guideway integrated in the supporting structure, one revolving chain, one lower guiding section, spray water device, a screenings collecting trough, drive unit, overload protection and a protective splashing guard. The head section of the screen frame incorporates, a solid main shaft, the sprocket wheel and the spray pipe as well as the splash guard. The base frame supports the rotating main shaft with flanged sprocket wheel.  The spray pipe is arranged in such a way as to produce the maximum spraying efficiency.
3.	The mesh panels are secured on one endless revolving side bar chain to form the MultiDisc screen. The chain strand run on a large sprocket wheel and is directed through the lateral chain guideways. The mesh panels themselves are sealed by overlapping each other on the upstream side. Debris retained in the screen mesh and on the debris carriers is sprayed off as the mesh panels reach the position of the spray pipe and is collected in the debris collecting trough.
4.	The MultiDisc Screen is being driven by a frequency converter controlled geared motor in combination with a bevel gear as speed reducer. The drive unit is directly mounted on the main shaft thus avoiding an additional chain-drive assembly. The entire drive unit is set up outside of the splash guard and therefore free from direct exposure to liquid medium.  The overload protection is effected electronically by the frequency converter. In the event of an overload occurrence an electronic switch interrupts the electrical circuit and stops the MultiDisc Screen and a failure signal will be triggered.

6.	Operations Crew Learning for Trash-Rack Waterfall Calculation
While performing trash-rack inspections, the CW NEO reported a significant waterfall with an extremely low bay level.  A review of the CW logs showed that the trash-rack waterfall readings were being recorded as unsat with a note stating, “> 1ft waterfall”.  The waterfall was a direct result of the unavailability of the trash-rakes which prevented Site Services from raking for the previous 4 days and was only evident during low tide levels.

Trash-Rack Waterfall can be calculated.  The Radar consolidator displays two indications (both in inches); travelling screen Differential and bay level.  For instance, the indications showed screen differential at 5 inches with bay level at 397 inches.  Referencing the TP below shows that the bottom of the bay is at an elevation of 50’.  Adding this to the bay level indication of 397 inches equates to approximately 83’.  Adding the 5 inch differential across the screen puts the level of the water in-between the screen and the trash-rack at 83’5”.  Subtracting this from the tide level of 88’ revealed that the calculated trash-rack waterfall was actually 4’7”.
